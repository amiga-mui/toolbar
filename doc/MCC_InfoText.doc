This is simply a subclass of Text.mui which features a fancy border. This is
especially useful for a class such as Toolbar.mcc (see the example code in
the Toolbar.mcc distribution archive), but can also be used for other
purposes.

It is VERY important to notice that the class is a subclass of Text.mui.
This means that all the attributes described in the autodoc "MUI_Text.doc"
can be used with this class as well.

InfoText.mcc is naturally freeware. You can use it in whatever you like even
commercial programs. Unfortunately I do not know who originally created the
graphics (the fancy letter 'i'), but I hope he/she doesn't mind that I have
used it in this class.

InfoText.mcc/MUIA_InfoText_Contents

    NAME
	MUIA_InfoText_Contents -- [.SG], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	This attribute has almost the same effect as the normal
	MUIA_Text_Contents. The only difference is that this attribute
	has a timeout feature. This means that the text is cleared after
	a certain period of time. You can adjust this period with the attribute
	MUIA_InfoText_ExpirationPeriod.

	This extra feature is especially useful when some kind of error-text
	needs to be displayed.

    EXAMPLE
	/* It works just as the normal text attribute */
	set(info_obj, MUIA_InfoText_Contents, "Error: Intel Inside");

    NOTES
	Please note that you can use all the attributes which
	are available in the standard text class.

    BUGS
	No known bugs.

InfoText.mcc/MUIA_InfoText_ExpirationPeriod

    NAME
	MUIA_InfoText_ExpirationPeriod -- [ISG], ULONG

    FUNCTION
	With this attribute you can set the period of expiration for the
	MUIA_InfoText_Contents attribute. The argument is in milliseconds
	and the default is 4000.

    NOTES

    BUGS
	No known bugs.

InfoText.mcc/MUIA_InfoText_FallBackText

    NAME
	MUIA_InfoText_FallBackText -- [ISG], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	With this attribute you can specify a text that should be displayed
	when there is no text specified with MUIA_Text_Contents or
	MUIA_InfoText_Contents.

	An example might be the best way to illustrate the idea.

	Instruction                                        Displayed
	-------------------------------------------------+------------
	set(obj, MUIA_Text_Contents,         "Hello"  )  |  Hello
	set(obj, MUIA_InfoText_FallBackText, "Default")  |  Hello
	set(obj, MUIA_Text_Contents,         NULL     )  |  Default
	set(obj, MUIA_Text_Contents,         "Hello2" )  |  Hello2
	set(obj, MUIA_Text_Contents,         NULL     )  |  Default

InfoText.mcc/MUIM_InfoText_TimeOut

    NAME
	MUIM_InfoText_TimeOut

    FUNCTION
	With this method you can force the text to timeout. The text is
	always 'cleared' when this method is used even if the attribute
	MUIA_InfoText_Contents hasn't been used earlier.

	If a fallback text is defined this will be used instead of a blank
	line.

    NOTES

    BUGS
	No known bugs.
